### Automate Your Instagram Cleanup

**unfriendr** is a Python-based Instagram automation bot designed to help you unfollow accounts you no longer interact with. If your feed has become a cluttered mess from mindless following, this tool will help you curate it back to something meaningful.

> I built this as a fun way to learn web automation and also to solve a personal problem‚Äîkeeping my Instagram feed relevant and engaging.

## üöÄ Features
- Automatically identifies accounts you follow but don‚Äôt engage with.
- Unfollows accounts in a safe, controlled manner (default: 25 per run, adjustable to 50 after a week).
- Allows exceptions for accounts you never want to unfollow.
- Uses Selenium and Firefox for web automation.
