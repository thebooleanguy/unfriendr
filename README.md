# unfriendr
An Instagram automation bot to help you unfollow people you don't interact with. Built with Python.

Still a work in progress.

When I use Instagram, I seem to mindlessly follow random accounts as they pop up and before you know it your feed is cluttered with stuff you don't even like.
So my goal is to kind of circumvent that, and aid in creating a somewhat curated and thoughtful feed.
